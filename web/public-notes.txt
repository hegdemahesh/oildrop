Public folder note: Vite serves root. PWA icons referenced in manifest must exist in dist root after build.
Add the following PNGs to the project root (or place them in /public if created):
- pwa-192x192.png
- pwa-512x512.png
- pwa-512x512-maskable.png
Currently not provided; add appropriately sized square icons.
